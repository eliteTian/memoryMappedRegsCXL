# memoryMappedRegsCXL
The codes here obtains memory mapped registers of a CXL device in host system. Programs run under Linux.
2 seperate programs exist to read out different portions of the memory mapped registers.

Codes are not entirely written by me from scratch but largely based upon other's code.
